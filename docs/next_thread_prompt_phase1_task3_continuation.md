# Thread Continuation: Phase 1 Task 3 - Risk Management Test Coverage

## Current Status
- Working on improving test coverage for risk_management.py
- Current coverage: Still needs improvement from initial 13.54% to target 95%
- Several test failures need to be addressed

## Key Issues to Resolve
1. Risk assessment thresholds not properly handling normal trading conditions
2. Position value calculations inconsistent with test expectations
3. Order validation error messages not matching test requirements
4. Loss limit checks not properly integrated

## Current Implementation State
The RiskManager class has been updated with:
- New buffer calculations for position limits
- Revised risk assessment logic
- Updated order validation
- Modified position value calculations

## Required Changes
1. Adjust risk thresholds in _initialize_thresholds:
   - Review min_position_value calculation (currently 0.0375 vs expected 0.075)
   - Update max_position_value handling

2. Fix assess_risk logic:
   - Allow normal trading within standard bounds
   - Properly handle market data absence
   - Adjust volatility checks

3. Correct order validation:
   - Standardize error messages
   - Fix position limit checks
   - Properly handle loss limits

4. Update position value calculation:
   - Ensure proper handling of edge cases
   - Fix negative price handling
   - Match expected test behaviors

## Test Cases to Focus On
1. test_assess_risk_normal_conditions
2. test_validate_order_success
3. test_calculate_position_value
4. test_validate_order_position_limit_with_low_liquidity

## Next Steps
1. Review and adjust threshold calculations
2. Update error message formatting
3. Fix position value handling
4. Implement proper loss limit checks
5. Rerun tests and verify coverage

## Project Context
- Part of CryptoJ Trader automated trading system
- Critical component for risk management and trade validation
- Must maintain high reliability and accuracy
- Integration with other components (market data, order execution)

## Key Files
1. crypto_j_trader/src/trading/risk_management.py
2. crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_risk_management.py

## Test Requirements
- Must achieve 95% test coverage
- All test cases must pass
- Error messages must be consistent
- Edge cases must be properly handled

Continue implementation with focus on maintaining proper risk management while fixing test cases.
