# Emergency Procedures

## Overview
This document details the emergency procedures and protocols for the CryptoJ Trading system's paper trading operations. These procedures must be followed in any critical situation to ensure system safety and data integrity.

## Emergency Shutdown Triggers

### 1. System-Level Triggers
```json
{
  "cpuUsage": 90,          // Percentage threshold
  "memoryUsage": 85,       // Percentage threshold
  "responseLatency": 1000, // Milliseconds
  "errorRate": 5          // Errors per minute
}
```

### 2. Trading-Level Triggers
```json
{
  "dailyLoss": "5%",       // Maximum daily drawdown
  "positionLoss": "2%",    // Single position loss limit
  "orderFrequency": 10,    // Orders per minute
  "dataLatency": 5000     // Market data delay in ms
}
```

### 3. Market-Level Triggers
```json
{
  "priceVolatility": "5%",  // Sudden price change
  "spreadDeviation": "2%",  // Abnormal spread
  "volumeDeviation": "300%", // Unusual volume spike
  "marketDataGap": 30      // Seconds without updates
}
```

## Emergency Response Procedures

### 1. Immediate Response Protocol

    A[Detect Emergency] --> B[Initiate Shutdown]
    B --> C[Cancel All Orders]
    C --> D[Record System State]
    D --> E[Alert Key Personnel]
    E --> F[Secure Positions]
```

**Steps:**
1. System Pause
   - Halt all trading operations
   - Cancel pending orders
   - Prevent new order submission
   - Lock position modifications

2. State Capture
   - Record all open positions
   - Save system configuration
   - Capture market data state
   - Log trigger conditions

3. Notification
   - Alert system administrators
   - Notify risk managers
   - Record incident details
   - Initialize response team

    A[Emergency Detection] --> B{Assess Severity}
    B -->|Critical| C[Full Shutdown]
    B -->|High| D[Partial Shutdown]
    B -->|Medium| E[Trading Pause]
    C --> F[Execute Recovery Plan]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

## System Recovery Process

### 1. Assessment Phase
1. **System Analysis**
   - Check system logs
   - Analyze error reports
   - Review state dumps
   - Verify data integrity

2. **Impact Evaluation**
   - Assess position status
   - Calculate potential losses
   - Review affected components
   - Document findings

### 2. Recovery Steps
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Begin Recovery] --> B[Verify Backups]
    B --> C[Restore State]
    C --> D[Validate Data]
    D --> E[Test Systems]
    E -->|Pass| F[Resume Operations]
    E -->|Fail| G[Continue Recovery]
```
