# Paper Trading Launch Plan - Feb 5, 2025

## Phase 1: Core Test Coverage (Critical Path)

### Task 1: Trading Core Tests
```bash
# Task Init Command
roo code "Implement missing tests for trading_core.py. Focus on:
1. Core trading functionality
2. Order processing logic
3. Market data integration
Current coverage: 0%, Target: 95%
Start by showing current test_trading_core.py contents."
```

**Coverage Target**: 95%
**Current Coverage**: 0%
**File**: trading_core.py

### Task 2: Order Execution Tests
```bash
# Task Init Command
roo code "Implement missing tests for order_execution.py. Focus on:
1. Market order execution
2. Position tracking
3. Order status management
Current coverage: 0%, Target: 95%
Show current test_order_execution.py contents."
```

**Coverage Target**: 95%
**Current Coverage**: 0%
**File**: order_execution.py

### Task 3: Risk Management Tests
```bash
# Task Init Command
roo code "Enhance test coverage for risk_management.py. Focus on:
1. Position limit checks
2. Loss limit enforcement
3. Risk calculations
Current coverage: 13.54%, Target: 95%
Show current test_risk_management.py contents."
```

**Coverage Target**: 95%
**Current Coverage**: 13.54%
**File**: risk_management.py

### Task 4: Emergency Manager Tests
```bash
# Task Init Command
roo code "Complete test coverage for emergency_manager.py. Focus on:
1. Emergency shutdown triggers
2. Position closing logic
3. System state management
Current coverage: 12.41%, Target: 95%
Show current test_emergency_manager.py contents."
```

**Coverage Target**: 95%
**Current Coverage**: 12.41%
**File**: emergency_manager.py

## Phase 2: Configuration (After Test Coverage Complete)

```bash
# Task Init Command
roo code "Initialize and verify configuration:
1. Run python scripts/init_config.py
2. Configure paper trading mode in config/cdp_api_key.json
3. Verify environment variables
Show current configuration status."
```

## Execution Strategy

1. Execute Phase 1 tasks sequentially, as each component builds upon the others
2. Only proceed to Phase 2 after achieving required test coverage
3. Each task should be completed and verified before moving to the next

### Coverage Verification Command
```bash
pytest --cov=crypto_j_trader --cov-report=xml
```

### Success Criteria
- All critical components meet 95% test coverage
- Paper trading mode is properly configured
- Basic system safety checks pass

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1
- [ ] Task 1: Trading Core Tests
- [ ] Task 2: Order Execution Tests
- [ ] Task 3: Risk Management Tests
- [ ] Task 4: Emergency Manager Tests

### Phase 2
- [ ] Configuration Setup
- [ ] Final Verification

## Notes
- Additional tasks can be addressed after successful paper trading launch
- Each task should be completed and verified independently
- Test coverage must meet targets before proceeding to configuration
