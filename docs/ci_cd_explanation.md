# CI/CD Explained

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. While it sounds complex, it's simply a way to automatically check your code for problems when you make changes.

## What It Does

1. Continuous Integration (CI):
- Automatically runs your tests when you update code
- Checks if new code works with existing code
- Helps catch problems early

Example:
- You update the risk management code
- System automatically runs all tests
- You get notified if anything breaks

2. Continuous Deployment (CD):
- Automatically moves tested code to production
- Ensures consistent deployment process
- Reduces manual errors

For a trading system, this means:
- Code changes are automatically tested
- Risk management rules are verified
- System health checks are automated
- Trading strategies are validated

## Simple Implementation

For our trading system, we can start with basic checks:
1. Run unit tests automatically
2. Verify risk parameters are within limits
3. Check system configuration
4. Validate trading rules

This helps ensure:
- Trading system remains stable
- Risk management stays effective
- No accidental configuration changes

We don't need complex CI/CD to start - we can begin with simple automated testing and gradually add more checks as needed.

## Next Steps

Instead of implementing CI/CD now, we should focus on:
1. Completing core trading functionality
2. Testing risk management systems
3. Validating through paper trading
4. Documenting deployment processes

We can add automated testing later when the system is more mature and proven through live trading.
