# Architectural Decisions

## Overview

This document outlines the key architectural decisions made for the CryptoJ Trading System. It provides context and rationale for each decision to help understand the system's design and evolution.

## Decision 1: Layered Architecture

### Context
The system needs to support multiple environments (development, production, test) and ensure separation of concerns.

### Decision
Adopt a layered architecture with distinct layers for:
- Configuration management
- Trading logic
- Risk management
- Emergency management

### Rationale
This approach ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Decision 2: Configuration Management

### Context
Configurations need to be managed securely and support different environments.

### Decision
Use a layered configuration approach with environment-specific settings and secure storage for sensitive data.

### Rationale
This ensures flexibility and security in managing configurations.

## Decision 3: API Integration

### Context
The system integrates with the Coinbase Advanced Trade API for trading operations.

### Decision
Encapsulate API interactions in a dedicated module with robust error handling and retry mechanisms.

### Rationale
This ensures reliable and maintainable integration with external APIs.

## Decision 4: Asynchronous Processing

### Context
The system needs to handle real-time market data and execute trades efficiently.

### Decision
Use asynchronous processing for market data handling and trade execution.

### Rationale
This improves performance and responsiveness.

## Decision 5: Testing Strategy

### Context
The system requires thorough testing to ensure reliability and correctness.

### Decision
Adopt a comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

### Rationale
This ensures the system is robust and reliable.

## Additional Decisions

- Use environment variables for sensitive values
- Implement regular security checks and audits
- Use secure backups and document recovery procedures

## Future Considerations

- Explore additional trading pairs and markets
- Enhance risk management strategies
- Implement advanced monitoring and alerting
