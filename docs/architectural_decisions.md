# Architectural Decisions Record - January 28, 2025

## Overview
This document captures key architectural decisions and next steps following a comprehensive review of the CryptoJ Trader system.

## Key Decisions

### 1. Portfolio Rebalancing Safety
- **Decision**: Implement mutex-based synchronization for portfolio operations
- **Rationale**: Prevent race conditions during high volatility periods
- **Impact**: Improved system stability and transaction safety
- **Implementation**: Add mutex locks and transaction rollback capability

### 2. WebSocket Enhancement
- **Decision**: Implement robust message queue system with persistence
- **Rationale**: Ensure no data loss during connection issues
- **Impact**: Improved system reliability and data consistency
- **Implementation**: Add message buffering, heartbeat monitoring, and reconnection logic

### 3. Risk Management Integration
- **Decision**: Create unified risk event system
- **Rationale**: Better coordination between risk management and trading operations
- **Impact**: Enhanced system safety and risk control
- **Implementation**: Synchronize risk parameters across components

### 4. System Monitoring
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive health monitoring
- **Rationale**: Early detection of potential issues
- **Impact**: Improved system reliability and maintenance
- **Implementation**: Add health checks and performance metrics
