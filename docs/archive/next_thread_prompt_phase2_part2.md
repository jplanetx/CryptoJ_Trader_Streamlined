## Current Status

### Completed (Hours 6-8)
- ✓ Testing infrastructure implemented
- ✓ Directory structure organized
- ✓ Async testing support added
- ✓ Mock system created
- ✓ Test configuration established
- ✓ Example tests passing

### Coverage Status
```
Total Coverage: 14% (Target: 85%)
Key Components:
- coinbase_api.py: 39%
- exchange_service.py: 40%
- trading_core.py: 9%
- websocket_handler.py: 9%
```

### Current Architecture
```python
CoinbaseAdvancedClient  # API interaction

    # Test OrderExecutor with ExchangeService
    pass
```

2. API Integration
```python
@pytest.mark.api
async def test_api_error_handling():
    # Test API error scenarios
    pass

@pytest.mark.api
async def test_rate_limiting():
    # Test API rate limiting behavior
    pass
```

3. Performance Testing
```python
@pytest.mark.performance

## Available Resources
- Testing infrastructure in place
- Mock system implemented
- Example tests for reference
- Coverage reporting configured

## Timeline
Hours 8-10 of 24-hour implementation plan
- Critical path testing: 1 hour
- API integration: 30 minutes
- Service integration: 30 minutes
- Performance testing: 1 hour

## Notes
1. Prioritize critical trading paths
2. Focus on error scenarios
3. Document performance baselines
4. Consider edge cases
5. Test async behavior thoroughly

Start with implementing critical path integration tests and gradually expand coverage to other areas. Use the existing mock system and test utilities to create comprehensive test scenarios.
