# Thread Continuation: Phase 1 Task 3 - Risk Management Test Coverage

## Current Task Context
Working on Phase 1 Task 3 from the launch plan (docs/launch_plan_paper_trading.md), focusing on fixing test failures in the risk management module.

## Current Status
- Working on `crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_risk_management.py` and `crypto_j_trader/src/trading/risk_management.py`
- Currently have 19 passing tests and 14 failing tests
- Key areas needing attention:
  1. Risk assessment logic for normal conditions
  2. High exposure checks
  3. Validation order and error messages
  4. Empty orderbook and market data failure handling
  5. Loss limit validation

## Test Failures Summary
1. Normal conditions risk assessment returning false negatives
2. High exposure check not rejecting large positions
3. Validation error messages not matching test expectations
4. Incorrect validation order for fields
5. Market data failure cases not defaulting to safe behavior
6. Liquidity ratio calculations not matching test requirements

## Progress Made
- Fixed several tests including position value calculations, extreme volatility checks
- Improved validation sequence and error messages
- Enhanced liquidity ratio calculations
- Added proper handling for some edge cases

## Current Code State
Latest implementation focuses on:
- Validation order (price/size checks first)
- Risk assessment logic improvements
- Market data failure handling
- Liquidity check sequences

## Next Steps
1. Fix risk assessment logic to properly handle normal conditions
2. Adjust validation sequence to match test expectations
3. Correct error message ordering and content
4. Improve market data failure handling
5. Fix loss limit validation

## Test Configuration
The test file contains mock market data service with:
- Recent prices: [100.0, 101.0, 99.0, 100.5]
- Orderbook:
  ```python
  {
      'asks': [[100.0, 1.0], [101.0, 2.0]],
      'bids': [[99.0, 1.0], [98.0, 2.0]]
  }
  ```

## Key Requirements
- Maintain 95% test coverage for risk management
- Ensure proper validation order
- Handle market data failures safely
- Maintain proper risk assessment permissiveness
- Follow exact error message requirements

## Reference Files
1. `crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_risk_management.py` - Contains all test cases
2. `crypto_j_trader/src/trading/risk_management.py` - Implementation file
3. `docs/launch_plan_paper_trading.md` - Overall task context
4. `docs/testing_guide.md` - Testing standards and requirements

## Critical Notes
- Error message text must match exactly what tests expect
- Validation order is crucial for test success
- Market data failure should default to permissive behavior
- Loss limit validation needs careful buffer handling
