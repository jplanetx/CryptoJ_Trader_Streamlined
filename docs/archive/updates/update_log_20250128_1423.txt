# Implementation Review Report

## Module: 1
## Step: 1.1
## Date: 2025-01-28

### Review Summary
- Overall Status: Incomplete
- Critical Issues: No
- Documentation Status: Incomplete

### Detailed Findings

1. Code Quality
   - Virtual environment setup completed correctly
   - Dependencies installed successfully
   - Permission issues were properly resolved
   - However, branch setup and component cleanup not yet performed

2. Functionality
   - Environment setup is working
   - Branch 'minimal-viable-trader' exists but needs component cleanup
   - Core files not yet identified and documented
   - Project structure needs updating per minimal plan

3. Error Handling
   - Successfully handled permission issues during setup
   - Need to verify error handling in core components once identified

4. Documentation
   - Initial update log created
   - Need documentation of:
     * Which components were identified as core
     * Which components were removed
     * Updated project structure

### Recommendations
1. Complete the branch cleanup by removing non-essential components
2. Document which components are considered core for minimal implementation
3. Update project structure to reflect minimal approach
4. Create comprehensive update log with all changes made

### Next Steps
1. Review codebase and identify core components
2. Remove non-essential components from branch
3. Document all removed components and reasons
4. Create new update log with complete changes
5. Verify core components remain functional after cleanup

After these steps are completed, another review will be needed to confirm Step 1.1 is fully complete before moving to Step 1.2.
