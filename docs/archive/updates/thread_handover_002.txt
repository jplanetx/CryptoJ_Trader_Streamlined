THREAD HANDOVER UPDATE - Emergency Manager Implementation

Current Status:
- Implemented validate_new_position method in EmergencyManager
- Fixed JSON persistence issues in save_state
- Updated knowledge graph with new components and relations
- All emergency shutdown tests passing

Last Changes Completed:
1. Added validate_new_position method:
   - Blocks positions during emergency shutdown
   - Validates against system health checks
   - Checks market conditions (price movement, volume spikes)
   - Enforces position size limits
   - Integrates with RiskManager

2. Enhanced save_state method:
   - Implemented atomic writes using temporary files
   - Improved error handling and cleanup
   - Added system health checks to persisted state

3. Updated test coverage:
   - Emergency shutdown persistence tests fixed
   - System health monitoring tests passing
   - Position validation tests integrated

Next Thread Priorities:
1. Order Execution Implementation:
   - Fix "No position exists" error in test_execute_limit_order
   - Address mock call verification failures in buy/sell order tests
   - Ensure proper position tracking

2. Required Files to Modify:
   - crypto_j_trader/src/trading/order_execution.py
   - crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_order_execution.py

3. Integration Points:
   - EmergencyManager.validate_new_position
   - RiskManager position validation
   - Order execution flow

4. Known Issues to Address:
   - Position initialization in order execution
   - Mock verification in order tests
   - Position tracking consistency

Key Knowledge Graph Updates:
- Added EmergencyManager component
- Added ValidateNewPosition method
- Established integration relationship with RiskManager

Testing Requirements:
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Add specific tests for position initialization
- Ensure order execution tests pass
- Validate position tracking

CI/CD Considerations:
- All emergency mode tests passing
- New position validation integrated
- Documentation updated

Security Notes:
- Position validation enforces size limits
- Emergency mode blocks new positions
- System health checks mandatory
