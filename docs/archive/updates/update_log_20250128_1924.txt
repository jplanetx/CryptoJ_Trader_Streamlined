Task: Implement WebSocket Market Data Handler
Status: Completed

Changes Made:
1. Created WebSocket handler implementation with:
   - Basic connection and subscription management
   - Reliable price data processing
   - Error recovery with exponential backoff
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Strong typing with type hints

Implementation Details:
1. WebSocket Connection
   - Used websockets library for async WebSocket communication
   - Added ping/pong for connection health monitoring (30s interval)
   - Implemented auto-reconnection with exponential backoff (1-60s)

2. Price Data Handling
   - JSON message parsing with error handling
   - Callback system for price updates by trading pair
   - Timestamp tracking for last received message
   - Structured data validation

3. Error Recovery
   - Exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
   - Comprehensive error logging
   - Graceful connection closure handling
   - Message processing error isolation

4. Testing
   - Verified against existing unit tests
   - Confirmed handling of:
     * Connection establishment
     * Message processing
     * Reconnection behavior
     * Callback registration
     * Error scenarios

Improvements:
- Added ping/pong keepalive mechanism
- Enhanced logging with detailed error information
- Improved type safety with Python type hints
- Isolated error handling per trading pair
- Added connection state tracking

Next Steps:
- Monitor system in production for any edge cases
- Consider adding message rate limiting
- Implement message queue for high-volume scenarios
