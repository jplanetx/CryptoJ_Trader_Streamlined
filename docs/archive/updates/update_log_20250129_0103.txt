# Implementation Update Log
Date: 2025-01-29
Time: 01:03
Step: 3.1 (Core Testing)
Status: Review Required

CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

1. WebSocket Handler Issues:
   - Constructor mismatch between code and tests
   - All websocket tests failing (5 errors)
   - Callback registration problems not resolved

2. Market Data Component Issues:
   - API response handling not matching test expectations
   - Data format inconsistencies (10 failures)
   - Error handling not working as expected

3. Emergency Manager Problems:
   - Emergency conditions reporting opposite of expected
   - Health checks failing in multiple scenarios

FAILURE DETAILS:

1. Emergency Tests (2 failures):
   - test_websocket_connection_health
   - test_market_data_freshness

2. Market Data Tests (9 failures):
   - Data retrieval not working
   - API error handling incomplete
   - Response format mismatches
   - Column ordering issues
   - Type conversion problems (string vs float)

3. WebSocket Tests (5 errors):
   - Constructor signature mismatch
   - Callback registration mechanism broken

Next Steps Required:
1. Reconcile WebSocket handler interface with tests
2. Fix market data response processing
3. Review and align emergency manager logic
4. Consider test-first approach for next iteration

Current Progress:
- Base functionality implemented
- Integration tests mostly passing
- Core trading components stable
- Configuration and setup working

Blocking Issues:
1. Market data component needs complete revision
2. WebSocket handler design mismatch
3. Emergency manager logic reversed

Recommendation:
Consider rolling back recent changes and implementing one component at a time with stricter test-driven development approach.
