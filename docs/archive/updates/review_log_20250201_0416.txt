Time: 04:16 (24-hour format)
Module: 3
Step: 1

### Review Summary
- Overall Status: Incomplete
- Critical Issues: Yes (2 remaining test failures)
- Documentation Status: Complete

### Detailed Findings

1. Code Quality
   - Risk management implementation is robust
   - Error handling properly implemented
   - Type checking and validation improved
   - Clear code organization and documentation

2. Functionality
   - Risk assessment working but needs tuning
   - Order validation sequence corrected
   - Emergency mode needs implementation
   - Position validation framework in place

3. Error Handling
   - Basic error handling implemented
   - Need more comprehensive error scenarios
   - WebSocket error handling incomplete
   - Recovery procedures need testing

4. Documentation
   - Implementation logs maintained
   - Test cases well documented
   - Need integration test documentation
   - Success criteria tracking in place

### Recommendations
1. Complete remaining risk management test fixes
2. Focus on emergency mode implementation
3. Add integration tests before moving to paper trading
4. Review current implementation against minimal viable implementation guide

### Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test failures in risk management
2. Begin emergency mode implementation
3. Design integration test scenarios
4. Update test coverage report
5. Review paper trading prerequisites
