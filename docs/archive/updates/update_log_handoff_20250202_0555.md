# CryptoJ Trader Development Update - Handoff Log
 
**Date:** 2025-02-02 05:55 PST
 
## Status
 
**Current Status:** Phase 6 - Test Suite Implementation and Debugging
 
**Overall Project Health:** Tests are failing, indicating unresolved infrastructure issues. Core modules are implemented, but require thorough testing and verification.
 
## Completed Work
 
- **Implemented Core Modules:**
  - Risk Management (`crypto_j_trader/src/trading/risk_management.py`)
  - Emergency Manager (`crypto_j_trader/src/trading/emergency_manager.py`)
  - Health Monitor (`crypto_j_trader/src/trading/health_monitor.py`)
  - WebSocket Handler (`crypto_j_trader/src/trading/websocket_handler.py`)
 
- **Implemented Test Suites:**
  - Unit tests for Risk Management (`crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_risk_management.py`)
  - Unit tests for Emergency Manager (`crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_emergency_manager.py`)
  - Unit tests for Health Monitor (`crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_health_monitor.py`)
  - Unit tests for WebSocket Handler (`crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_websocket_handler.py`)
 
## Technical Details
 
- **Key Code Changes:** Implementation of core trading logic within the modules listed above. Focus on modularity and testability.
- **API Integrations:** No new API integrations in this phase.
- **Dependencies:** 
  - pytest
  - pytest-asyncio
  - pytest-mock
  - pytest-cov
  - websockets
  - psutil
 
## Testing
 
**Test Coverage Status:** Test suites implemented, but all tests are currently failing. Coverage cannot be accurately assessed until tests are passing.
 
**Quality Metrics:** Test pass rate is currently 0%. Need to achieve a high pass rate and coverage after resolving infrastructure issues.
 
## Next Steps
 
- **Immediate Priorities:**
  1. Resolve test infrastructure issues (path resolution, import errors, pytest configuration).
  2. Debug and fix failing tests in unit test suites.
  3. Verify asynchronous test configurations with pytest-asyncio.
  4. Ensure proper mock implementations for dependencies.
 
- **Next Task for Next Thread:** Focus on debugging and fixing the test suite. Refer to `docs/next_thread_prompt_phase7.md` for detailed debugging guidance.
