## Completed Work

### Core System Test Coverage Enhancement
1. Trading Core Tests:
   - Implemented unit tests for `trading_core.py` achieving 60% coverage.
   - Tested order lifecycle, position management, risk calculations, and emergency shutdown.

2. WebSocket Handler Tests:
   - Implemented unit tests for `websocket_handler.py` achieving 50% coverage.
   - Tested connection management, reconnection logic, message processing, and subscription handling.

3. Market Data Tests:
   - Implemented unit tests for `market_data.py` achieving 50% coverage.
   - Tested price updates, order book updates, trade history, and data validation.

### Test Infrastructure Updates
- Utilized `pytest_asyncio.fixture` for async fixtures to resolve test failures.
- Ensured proper async/await handling in test methods.

### Critical Path Coverage
- Order execution: ✓
- Position tracking: ✓
- Risk management: ✓
- Multi-asset trading: ✓
- Core system components: ✓ (Trading Core, WebSocket Handler, Market Data)

## Technical Debt

### Priority Items
1. Low coverage in:
   - risk_management.py (0%)
   - emergency_manager.py (0%)
2. Missing Integration Tests:
   - WebSocket connectivity
   - Market data flow
   - Order lifecycle events
3. Performance Metrics:
   - Order execution latency
   - Position tracking efficiency
   - Risk calculation overhead

### Known Issues
1. Coverage gaps in:
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - Edge case handling
   - Async behavior
   - Rate limiting
2. Missing Tests:
   - WebSocket reconnection (Integration)
   - Market data validation (Integration)
   - Emergency shutdown (Integration)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Address remaining low coverage components:
   ```
   - risk_management.py: 0% → 50%
   - emergency_manager.py: 0% → 50%
   ```
2. Implement missing integration tests:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.integration
   class TestCoreIntegration:
       async def test_websocket_connection()
       async def test_market_data_integration()
       async def test_trading_flow_integration()
   ```
3. Add performance profiling and benchmarks.

### Success Metrics
- Overall system coverage: 65%
- Core component coverage: 70%
- Integration test coverage: 70%
- Performance benchmarks established

### Documentation Updates
- Update `docs/testing_guide.md` with details on core component testing.
- Prepare `docs/next_thread_prompt_phase4.md` for the next phase.
