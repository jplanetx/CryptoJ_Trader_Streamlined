# Implementation Update Log
Date: 2025-02-01
Time: 04:15 (24-hour format)
Step: Module.3.1
Status: In Progress

Changes Made:
- Implemented risk management core functionality
- Fixed risk exposure calculation and scaling
- Added proper error handling in risk validation
- Completed risk management unit tests
- Added type checking and validation improvements
- Fixed order validation sequence

Validation:
- 14/16 risk management tests passing
- Core risk assessment functionality working
- Order validation logic verified
- Position validation tests passing

Next Steps Required (Priority Order):
1. Core Testing Completion (Module 3.1)
   - Complete remaining risk management tests
   - Implement emergency mode tests
   - Add integration tests for risk management
   - Complete system health monitoring tests
   - Verify WebSocket error handling

2. Trading Core Verification (Module 2.1)
   - Review order execution implementation
   - Add position tracking tests
   - Verify risk control integration
   - Complete integration tests

3. Market Data Stability (Module 2.2)
   - Verify WebSocket connection handling
   - Test market data consistency
   - Add error recovery scenarios
   - Complete data flow tests

4. Paper Trading Prerequisites (Module 4.1)
   - Hold until core testing complete
   - Review paper trading configuration
   - Design validation procedures
   - Prepare monitoring setup

Critical Blockers:
1. Emergency mode implementation incomplete
2. Integration tests needed for core components
3. System health monitoring coverage insufficient
4. WebSocket error handling needs verification

Success Criteria Status:
1. Trade Execution: Needs verification
2. Risk Controls: Mostly complete (14/16 tests)
3. Market Data Flow: Basic implementation done
4. Position Tracking: Needs integration tests
5. Basic Monitoring: Needs implementation

Notes:
- Focus on completing Module 3.1 before moving to paper trading
- Prioritize critical path testing
- Document all test scenarios
- Follow systematic testing approach
