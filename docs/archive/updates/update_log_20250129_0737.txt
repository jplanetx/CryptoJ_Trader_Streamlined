Changes Made:
1. Updated market_data.py to handle paper trading mode
   - Added simulated market data generation
   - Implemented proper error handling
   - Added support for both real and simulated data fetching

2. Added missing methods to trading_core.py
   - Implemented TradingStrategy.analyze_market() with SMA and RSI indicators
   - Added PortfolioManager.needs_rebalance() for portfolio management
   - Fixed initialization order in TradingBot class

3. Updated config.json
   - Added execution configuration with interval settings
   - Paper trading mode is enabled by default

Current Status:
- Paper trading mode is working with simulated market data
- Basic trading strategy implemented with technical indicators
- Portfolio management framework in place

Next Steps:
1. Test full trading loop with paper trading
2. Add more sophisticated trading strategies
3. Implement proper portfolio rebalancing logic
4. Add position sizing and risk management rules
5. Implement proper error recovery mechanisms

Known Issues:
1. Emergency shutdown needs more robust handling of portfolio positions
2. WebSocket implementation needs testing with paper trading mode
3. Need to verify proper cleanup of resources during shutdown

Notes:
- Currently using simulated data with reasonable volatility for paper trading
- Technical analysis includes SMA (20/50) and RSI (14) indicators
- Portfolio rebalancing set to 24-hour intervals by default
- Error handling includes categorization for emergency shutdown decisions

Configuration Requirements:
- Ensure config.json has 'execution' section with 'interval_seconds'
- Keep paper_trading=true while testing
- Verify trading_pairs configuration matches intended market pairs

Review Points:
1. Verify trading strategy parameters are appropriate
2. Review error handling and shutdown procedures
3. Check portfolio management initialization
4. Test market data simulation parameters
