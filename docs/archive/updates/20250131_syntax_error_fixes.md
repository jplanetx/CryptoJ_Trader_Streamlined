# Update 20250131: Syntax Error Fixes Needed

## Current Status
Multiple syntax errors are preventing test execution:

1. Trading Core Issues:
- SyntaxError in trading_core.py: Invalid placeholder text "[Previous methods remain the same...]"
- Coverage parser unable to parse trading_core.py

2. WebSocket Handler Issues:
- SyntaxError in websocket_handler.py: Invalid placeholder text
- Related imports failing in market_data.py

3. Health Monitor Issues:
- SyntaxError in health_monitor.py: Invalid placeholder text
- Coverage parser unable to parse file

## Required Actions
1. Fix trading_core.py:
   - Remove placeholder "[Previous methods remain the same...]"
   - Implement complete class with all methods
   - Ensure proper Python syntax throughout file

2. Fix websocket_handler.py:
   - Remove placeholder "[Previous content of WebSocketHandler class...]"
   - Complete WebSocketHandler implementation
   - Fix import dependencies in market_data.py

3. Fix health_monitor.py:
   - Remove placeholder "[Previous content of HealthMonitor class...]"
   - Complete HealthMonitor implementation
   - Fix coverage parsing issues

4. Verify Changes:
   - Run tests after each file fix
   - Ensure no placeholder text remains
   - Check coverage reporting works

## Next Steps
1. Take each file individually and complete implementation
2. Maintain proper Python syntax (no placeholders or comments as code)
3. Run tests after each file fix to verify changes
4. Proceed to coverage improvements after syntax errors are resolved

## Test Status
- 44 items collected / 10 errors
- All errors are syntax-related
- Coverage reporting failing on key files

## Files Needing Attention
1. crypto_j_trader/src/trading/trading_core.py
2. crypto_j_trader/src/trading/websocket_handler.py
3. crypto_j_trader/src/trading/health_monitor.py
4. crypto_j_trader/src/trading/market_data.py

The issues appear to be from placeholder text that was accidentally left in the code. Each file needs to be properly completed with actual Python code rather than placeholder comments.
