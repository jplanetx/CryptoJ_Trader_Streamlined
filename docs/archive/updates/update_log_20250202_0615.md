# CryptoJ Trader Development Update - Phase 8 Log

**Date:** 2025-02-02 06:15 PST

## Status

**Current Status:** Phase 8 - Test Suite Debugging and Resolution. Debugging unit tests, specifically focusing on `test_emergency_manager.py` and `test_market_data.py`.

**Overall Project Health:** Unit tests for `emergency_manager` are now passing after resolving configuration and fixture issues. However, tests for `market_data` are still failing, indicating issues with mock exchange service implementation and test setup. Core modules implementation is ongoing, requiring thorough testing and verification.

## Completed Work

- **Test Suite Debugging - Emergency Manager:**
    - Resolved `FileNotFoundError` in `test_emergency_manager.py` by updating test configuration and path resolution.
    - Refactored `test_emergency_manager.py` to use pytest fixtures for better configuration and path handling.
    - Updated `config/test_config.json` with proper test data and structure.
    - All unit tests in `test_emergency_manager.py` are now passing.

## Technical Details

- **Key Code Changes:**
    - Modified `crypto_j_trader/tests/conftest.py` to include emergency manager fixtures and improve test configuration.
    - Updated `crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_emergency_manager.py` to use new fixtures and temporary directories for state management.
    - Created `MockExchangeService` class in `crypto_j_trader/tests/utils/mocks/coinbase_mocks.py` to provide a more complete mock implementation for exchange service.
    - Updated `crypto_j_trader/tests/utils/fixtures/config_fixtures.py` to use `MockExchangeService` for `mock_exchange_service` fixture.
    - Updated `config/test_config.json` to align with test requirements and include necessary configurations.

- **API Integrations:** No API integrations were the focus of this phase.

- **Dependencies:** No dependency changes in this phase.

## Testing

**Test Coverage Status:** Unit tests for `emergency_manager` are passing, but `market_data` tests are still failing. Overall test coverage is still to be determined accurately once all unit tests are passing.

**Quality Metrics:** 
    - `test_emergency_manager.py`: Pass rate is 100%.
    - `test_market_data.py`: Pass rate is currently low (60%), with ongoing debugging.

## Next Steps

- **Immediate Priorities:**
    1. Continue debugging `test_market_data.py` unit tests. Focus on resolving `AttributeError` and `fixture 'mocker' not found` errors.
    2. Investigate `mock_exchange_service` fixture and `MockExchangeService` implementation for correctness.
    3. Run `test_trading_core_quick.py` tests and start debugging failing tests in this suite.

- **Next Task for Next Thread:** Continue debugging and resolving failing unit tests, starting with `test_market_data.py` and `test_trading_core_quick.py`. Refer to `docs/next_thread_prompt_phase9.md` for detailed instructions.
