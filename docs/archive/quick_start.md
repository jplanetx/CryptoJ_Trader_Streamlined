# Quick Start Guide

## Getting Started
This guide helps you navigate the implementation plan for launching the CryptoJ Trading Bot.

## How to Use This System

### 1. Thread Management
- Each step is assigned to either a Code or Architect thread
- Only one thread should be active at a time
- Each thread must complete its deliverables before the next starts

### 2. Update Process
For each step:
1. Start the appropriate thread (Code or Architect)
2. Use the provided prompt for that step
3. Complete the deliverables
4. Create an update log with format: `update_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.txt`
5. Verify success criteria before proceeding

### 3. Module Sequence
```
Module 1: Environment Setup
├── Step 1.1: Virtual Environment (Code)
└── Step 1.2: Configuration Setup (Code)

Module 2: Testing & Validation
├── Step 2.1: Test Suite (Code)
└── Step 2.2: System Validation (Architect)

Module 3: Paper Trading
├── Step 3.1: Initial Launch (Code)
└── Step 3.2: Performance Assessment (Architect)

Module 4: Live Trading
├── Step 4.1: Live Configuration (Code)
└── Step 4.2: Live Launch (Architect)
```

### 4. Success Criteria
Before moving to the next step, verify:
- All deliverables are complete
- Update log is created
- No critical issues remain
- Next step is clearly defined

## Starting Point

1. Begin with Module 1, Step 1.1
2. Use the Code thread
3. Follow the prompt in implementation_plan.md
4. Create your first update log
5. Proceed only after success criteria are met

## Safety Notes
- Never skip validation steps
- Always review previous updates
- Maintain focus on system safety
- Document all changes and issues

## Need Help?
- Review the architectural_review.md for system context
- Check architectural_decisions.md for key decisions
- Follow implementation_plan.md for detailed steps
- Create detailed update logs for future reference

## Timeline Expectations
- Total implementation: 11-16 hours
- Take time to validate each step
- Don't rush safety checks
- Monitor paper trading thoroughly before live transition
