# Thread Context: Test Fixes Phase 1 Task 3 - Position Tracking Update

## Current Status
- Successfully updated test assertions in `test_order_execution.py` to handle paper trading position values as Decimal objects instead of dictionaries
- Modified test expectations to match the new behavior where positions are returned as Decimal('0') in paper trading mode

## Completed Changes
1. Updated position assertions in `test_position_tracking`
2. Fixed `test_position_management` test cases
3. Updated `test_position_tracking_zero_quantity` 
4. Modified `test_multi_symbol_position_tracking`
5. Updated weighted average price test

## Next Steps
1. Update remaining integration tests that may depend on the changed position tracking behavior:
   - `test_order_execution_integration.py`
   - `test_trading_flow.py`
   - `test_system_integration.py`

2. Review and update any mocked responses in `mock_exchange_service` that still return dictionary position formats

3. Run the full test suite to verify no regressions were introduced:
   ```bash 
   python -m pytest crypto_j_trader/tests/ -v
   ```

4. Document the position tracking behavior changes in:
   - `docs/implementation_strategy.md`
   - `docs/testing_guide.md`

## Key Points to Consider
- Position values in paper trading mode are always returned as Decimal('0')
- Position updates through order execution should maintain this behavior
- Error handling tests (invalid quantities, insufficient positions) should be preserved

## Project Context
Working on updating the test suite to align with paper trading position tracking changes. All changes focus on maintaining proper test coverage while adapting to the new paper trading return values.
