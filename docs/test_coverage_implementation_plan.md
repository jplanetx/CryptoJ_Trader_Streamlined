    WS[WebSocket Handler] --> |market data| MD[Market Data Handler]
    MD --> |processed data| TC[Trading Core]
    TC --> |status updates| HM[Health Monitor]
    MD --> |market data| RM[Risk Manager]
    RM --> |validation| TC
```

       # Test threshold monitoring
       # Test alert generation
       # Test alert delivery
   ```

3. Market Data Handler
   ```python
   def test_data_consistency():
       # Completed: Order book updates verified
       # Completed: Price feed consistency checked
       # Completed: Historical data management implemented
   ```

4. Risk Manager  # New section
   ```python
   def test_emergency_mode():
       # Test emergency mode activation
       # Test position validation
       # Test shutdown procedures
   ```

### Phase 2: Integration Testing
1. Data Flow Tests
   ```python
   def test_market_data_flow():
       # Completed: WebSocket → Market Data pipeline
       # Completed: Data transformation
       # Completed: Trading Core reception
   ```

2. System Health Tests
   ```python
   def test_system_health_integration():
       # Test component health reporting
       # Verify system-wide health status
       # Test alert propagation
   ```
