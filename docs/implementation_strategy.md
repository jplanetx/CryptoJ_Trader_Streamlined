# Implementation Strategy

## Thread Management

### When to Start a New Thread
1. When token usage gets high (around 40-50% usage)
2. When switching to a new major module
3. If current AI seems stuck or is giving inconsistent results
4. After completing a major component

### How to Switch Threads Effectively

1. Save Context Info:
```markdown
# Project Context Handoff

## Current Status
- What was just completed
- What's currently in progress
- Any pending issues

## Configuration Status
- Environment setup complete
- API credentials in cdp_api_key.json
- Environment variables configured

## Next Steps
- Next module to implement
- Specific tasks pending
- Known issues to address
```

2. Start New Thread Command:
```
Use the new_task tool with mode "code":

<new_task>
<mode>code</mode>
<message>Continue implementation from previous thread. Current status: [paste status]. Next step: [specific next step]</message>
</new_task>
```

## Implementation Modules & AI Instructions

### Module 1: Test Suite Fixes
To have AI fix tests:
```
Start conversation: "Fix test failures in crypto_j_trader/tests/. Start with test_trading_core.py and show me the current test failures."

Follow up with:
"Here are the test results: [paste test output]"
```

### Module 2: Paper Trading Implementation
To have AI implement paper trading:
```
Start conversation: "Implement paper trading functionality. Start by showing me the current paper_trading.py file structure."

Follow up with:
"Here's the current implementation: [paste file content]"
```

### Module 3: Risk Management
To have AI enhance risk management:
```
Start conversation: "Enhance risk management implementation. Show me the current risk_management.py contents."

Follow up with:
"Here's the current implementation: [paste file content]"
```

### Module 4: Health Monitoring
To have AI implement monitoring:
```
Start conversation: "Implement health monitoring system. Start with health_monitor.py review."

Follow up with:
"Here's the current implementation: [paste file content]"
```

### Module 5: Integration Testing
To have AI create integration tests:
```
Start conversation: "Create comprehensive integration tests. Start with test_paper_trading_integration.py."

Follow up with:
"Here are the current test results: [paste test output]"
```

### Module 6: Documentation
To have AI generate documentation:
```
Start conversation: "Generate comprehensive documentation. Start with updating README.md."

Follow up with:
"Here's the current documentation: [paste content]"
```

### Module 7: Launch Preparation
To have AI prepare launch checklist:
```
Start conversation: "Create launch preparation checklist and verification procedures for paper trading mode."

Follow up with:
"Here's the current system status: [paste relevant info]"
```

## Best Practices for AI Interaction

1. Clear Initial Context:
- Always start with specific file or component
- Provide current state/output
- Specify exact next step

2. Efficient Information Sharing:
- Share relevant file contents
- Provide test outputs
- Include error messages

3. Maintaining Progress:
- Save implementation plan status
- Track completed modules
- Note any issues for next thread

4. Thread Management:
- Monitor token usage
- Create new thread at module boundaries
- Pass context in new thread start

## Status Tracking Template
```markdown
## Implementation Progress

Module 1: Test Suite Fixes
- [ ] test_trading_core.py
- [ ] test_risk_management.py
- [ ] test_emergency_manager.py

Module 2: Paper Trading
- [ ] Basic implementation
- [ ] Order simulation
- [ ] Position tracking

[Continue for each module...]

## Current Thread Status
- Token Usage: XX%
- Current Module: [name]
- Current Task: [description]
- Pending Items: [list]

## Next Thread Planning
- Start Point: [specific task]
- Required Context: [list key info]
- Expected Deliverables: [list]
```

## Issue Recovery
If AI gets stuck:
1. Save current progress
2. Document specific issue
3. Start new thread with fresh context
4. Provide specific task and file state

## Success Criteria
- Each module has tests passing
- Documentation is complete
- Integration tests verify functionality
- Launch checklist is complete
