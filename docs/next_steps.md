# Next Steps: Path to Live Trading

## Executive Summary
Based on the current state of the project, we've identified a streamlined path to get the trading bot live within 2 weeks. This approach focuses on essential functionality first, removing unnecessary complexity.

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Start Fresh (Day 1)
- Create new branch 'minimal-viable-trader'
- Remove non-essential components (see codebase_cleanup.md)
- Keep only core trading functionality
- Simplify configuration

### 2. Essential Components
Keep only these core files:
```
trading_core.py     - Basic trading logic
risk_management.py  - Simple risk controls
websocket_handler.py - Market data
```

Remove or defer:
- Dynamic weight calculations
- Complex portfolio rebalancing
- Advanced monitoring systems
- Emergency shutdown complexity

## Implementation Path

### Week 1: Basic System
- Day 1: Clean setup and configuration
- Day 2: Core trading implementation
- Day 3: Basic testing
- Day 4-5: Paper trading validation

### Week 2: Live Trading
- Days 1-2: Live configuration
- Days 3-4: Controlled testing
- Day 5: Full live deployment

## Why This Will Work

1. **Reduced Complexity**
   - Fewer moving parts
   - Clearer system flow
   - Easier to test and validate

2. **Focus on Essentials**
   - Basic order execution
   - Simple risk management
   - Reliable market data
   - Position tracking

3. **Clear Success Criteria**
   - System executes trades
   - Risk limits work
   - Positions track correctly
   - Data flows reliably

## Getting Started

1. Begin with Module 1 in implementation_plan_minimal.md
2. Follow each step sequentially
3. Create update logs at each step
4. Validate before proceeding

## Future Enhancements
After successful live trading:
1. Add portfolio optimization
2. Enhance risk controls
3. Implement advanced monitoring
4. Add emergency procedures

## Documentation Reference
1. codebase_cleanup.md - What to remove/keep
2. implementation_plan_minimal.md - Step-by-step guide
3. architectural_review.md - System context
4. quick_start.md - Getting started guide

## Success Metrics
You'll know you're on track when:
1. Basic trades execute correctly
2. Risk limits prevent large losses
3. Positions track accurately
4. System runs stably
5. Data flows consistently

## Support Path
If issues arise:
1. Check update logs
2. Review test results
3. Verify configuration
4. Test in paper trading
5. Start small in live trading

## Remember
- Keep it simple
- Test thoroughly
- Document everything
- Validate each step
- Start small in live trading
