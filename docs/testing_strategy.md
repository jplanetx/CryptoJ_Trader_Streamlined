# Testing Strategy

## Overview

Our testing strategy ensures robust validation of the cryptocurrency trading system while maintaining high code quality and reliability. This document outlines our testing approach, coverage requirements, and best practices.

## Test Coverage Requirements

### Critical Components (95% Coverage)
- Trading Core
- Order Execution
- Risk Management
- Emergency Manager

### Supporting Components (85-90% Coverage)
- Market Data Handler
- Position Tracking
- WebSocket Handler
- Health Monitor

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Focus on edge cases and error handling
- Quick execution for rapid feedback

### Integration Tests
- Test component interactions
- Validate system workflows
- Use paper trading mode
- Focus on real-world scenarios

### System Tests
- End-to-end trading workflows
- Emergency procedures
- Risk management integration
- Performance validation

## Test Environment

### Paper Trading Mode
- Primary mode for automated tests
- Simulated market conditions
- No real trades or funds
- Configurable test scenarios

### Mock Services
- Mock exchange API
- Simulated market data
- Test-specific configurations
- Controlled error conditions

## Testing Tools

### Required Packages
- pytest
- pytest-asyncio
- pytest-cov
- pytest-mock
- pytest-timeout

### Configuration
```ini
[pytest]
asyncio_mode = auto
timeout = 300
markers =
    unit: Unit tests
    integration: Integration tests
    system: System tests
    performance: Performance tests
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Fixtures
- Standard test configurations
- Mock credentials
- Market data samples
- Position scenarios

### State Management
- Clean state before each test
- Proper cleanup after tests
- Isolated test environments
- State persistence validation

## Performance Testing

### Latency Requirements
- Order execution: <100ms
- Market data updates: <50ms
- Risk calculations: <20ms

### Load Testing
- Multiple trading pairs
- High frequency updates
- Concurrent operations
- Resource utilization

## Error Handling

### Test Categories
1. Input validation
2. Network failures
3. API errors
4. System resource limits
5. Concurrent operation issues

### Emergency Scenarios
- Market data interruptions
- Position limit breaches
- System health degradation
- Emergency shutdown procedures

## Test Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Mirror production code structure
- Clear test names and descriptions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Maintainable test code

### Best Practices
1. One assertion per test when possible
2. Clear setup and teardown
3. Meaningful error messages
4. Proper exception handling
5. Consistent naming conventions

### Mock Usage
- Mock external dependencies
- Simulate network conditions
- Control time-dependent operations
- Reproduce error scenarios

## Continuous Integration

### CI Pipeline
