# Testing Status Analysis

## Core Implementation vs Test Expectations Gap

### Missing Core Functionality
The test suite expects basic trading operations that aren't implemented:

1. Order Execution
   - Tests expect: `execute_order(side, size, price)` method
   - Current: Only empty `_execute_buy()` and `_execute_sell()` methods
   - Gap: Need to implement actual order execution logic

2. Position Management
   - Tests expect: `get_position()` returning position details
   - Current: Only high-level `PortfolioManager` with empty positions dict
   - Gap: Need to implement basic position tracking

3. Health Checks
   - Tests expect: `is_healthy` property and timestamp tracking
   - Current: No health monitoring implementation
   - Gap: Need to implement basic health checks

### Over-implemented Features
We've built complex features before basic ones:
- Technical Analysis (SMA, RSI calculations)
- Trading Strategy with market analysis
- Portfolio rebalancing logic

### Recommended Testing Approach

1. Simplify Implementation
   - Strip back to basic order execution
   - Implement simple position tracking
   - Add basic health monitoring

2. Test Structure
   - Start with basic functionality tests
   - Use mocks for exchange interactions
   - Verify core operations before testing strategies

3. Implementation Order
   ```python
   class TradingBot:
       def __init__(self, config):
           self.positions = {}
           self.is_healthy = True
           self.last_health_check = datetime.now()

       def execute_order(self, side, size, price):
           # Basic order execution
           order_id = f"test_order_id"  # For testing
           self.update_position(side, size, price)
           return {"status": "success", "order_id": order_id}

       def get_position(self):
           return {
               "size": self.positions.get("size", 0),
               "entry_price": self.positions.get("entry_price", 0),
               "unrealized_pnl": 0.0,
               "stop_loss": self.positions.get("stop_loss", 0)
           }

       def check_health(self):
           self.last_health_check = datetime.now()
           return self.is_healthy
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Implement Basic Operations
   - Build minimal order execution
   - Add simple position tracking
   - Implement health checks

2. Verify Core Tests
   - Run unit tests for basic functionality
   - Fix any failing assertions
   - Add missing test cases

3. Defer Complex Features
   - Move technical analysis to later phase
   - Keep portfolio management simple
   - Focus on passing core tests

4. Document Test Coverage
   - Track which tests are passing
   - Identify gaps in coverage
   - Plan for additional test cases
