## Handover Notes
Current system state:
- Basic paper trading infrastructure is in place and tested
- Core trading functionality (orders, positions) is working
- Test framework is set up and basic tests are passing

Critical areas to focus on:
1. Risk management integration needs completion
2. Market data handling requires implementation
3. Position tracking needs enhancement
4. Test coverage should be expanded

Key files to review:
- crypto_j_trader/src/trading/paper_trading.py - Core paper trading implementation
- crypto_j_trader/src/trading/order_execution.py - Order execution framework
- crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_basic.py - Basic functionality tests
- crypto_j_trader/tests/conftest.py - Test configuration and fixtures

Next steps require careful attention to:
1. Maintaining test coverage as features are added
2. Ensuring proper risk management integration
3. Validating market data handling
4. Verifying position tracking accuracy

Branch state:
- Main branch is stable with basic functionality
- Paper trading implementation is functional
- Tests are passing with proper configuration
