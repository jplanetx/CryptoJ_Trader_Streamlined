# Next Thread Prompt: Phase 5 - System-Wide Test Coverage Enhancement

## Background

The CryptoJ Trader project has successfully completed Phase 4, implementing and testing the Risk Management and Emergency Manager components. While these components now have excellent test coverage (93% and 100% respectively), the overall system coverage remains at 9%, far below the target of 85%. Key components like market data service, order execution, and websocket handler have minimal to no test coverage.

## Current Status

### Coverage Map
```
Component               Coverage    Status
-----------------------------------------
Overall System           9%        ❌ (Target: 85%)
risk_management.py      93%        ✓
emergency_manager.py    100%       ✓
trading_core.py         37%        ⚠️
market_data.py          27%        ❌
order_execution.py       0%        ❌
websocket_handler.py     0%        ❌
Other components         0%        ❌
```

### Established Infrastructure
```python
# Test Categories
@pytest.mark.unit         # Unit tests
@pytest.mark.integration  # Integration tests
@pytest.mark.performance  # Performance tests

# Core Test Fixtures
def mock_exchange_service()
def mock_market_data()
def trading_system()
```

## Development Priorities

1. Market Data Service (Target: 80% coverage)
   - Price history management
   - Real-time data handling
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - WebSocket connection management

2. Order Execution System (Target: 80% coverage)
   - Order placement logic
   - Order tracking
   - Error handling
   - Integration with risk management

3. WebSocket Handler (Target: 80% coverage)
   - Connection management
   - Message processing
   - Error handling
   - Reconnection logic

4. Integration Testing
   - Trading flow scenarios
   - Risk management integration
   - Emergency procedures
   - System-wide error handling

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Market Data Testing
```python
class TestMarketData:
    async def test_price_history_management():
        """Test price history storage and retrieval"""
        pass

    async def test_real_time_updates():
        """Test real-time data processing"""
        pass

    async def test_error_recovery():
        """Test system recovery from data errors"""
        pass
```

### 2. Order Execution Testing
```python
class TestOrderExecution:
    async def test_order_placement():
        """Test order creation and submission"""
        pass

    async def test_order_tracking():
        """Test order status monitoring"""
        pass

    async def test_risk_integration():
        """Test integration with risk management"""
        pass
```

### 3. WebSocket Handler Testing
```python
class TestWebSocketHandler:
    async def test_connection_management():
        """Test connection lifecycle"""
        pass

    async def test_message_processing():
        """Test message handling"""
        pass

    async def test_reconnection():
        """Test automatic reconnection"""
        pass
```

### 4. Integration Testing Requirements
```python
class TestSystemIntegration:
    async def test_trading_flow():
        """Test end-to-end trading scenario"""
        pass

    async def test_risk_emergency():
        """Test risk management and emergency procedures"""
        pass
```

## Success Criteria
