# Implementation Update Log
Date: 2025-02-01
Time: 15:30
Status: In Progress

## Current State
1. Test environment setup completed
2. Initial dependencies installed
3. Basic test structure in place

## Critical Findings
1. Coinbase API Migration Required
- Old coinbase-python package no longer supported
- Need to migrate to new Coinbase Advanced Trade API
- Documentation: https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/docs/welcome

2. Missing Dependencies Identified
- pytest-asyncio: Required for async test support
- websockets: Required for real-time data
- psutil: Required for system monitoring

3. Test Structure Issues
- Path inconsistencies between PT and New directories
- Missing async test support
- Import path issues need resolution

## Next Steps
1. API Migration
- Create new service layer for Coinbase Advanced Trade API
- Update order execution module
- Update market data handling

2. Dependency Resolution
- Add new dependencies to requirements.txt
- Update virtual environment setup
- Verify all dependencies installed

3. Test Infrastructure
- Fix directory structure
- Add async test support
- Update import paths

## Recommendations
1. Focus on Advanced Trade API integration first
2. Update test infrastructure in parallel
3. Create new service abstractions for API calls

## New Timeline
Hour 0-6:
- API Migration and Integration
