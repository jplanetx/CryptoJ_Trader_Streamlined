### Review Summary
- Overall Status: Complete
- Critical Issues: No
- Documentation Status: Complete

### Detailed Findings
1. Code Quality
   - Robust WebSocket implementation with proper async/await patterns
   - Strong type hints throughout the codebase
   - Clean separation of concerns in WebSocketHandler class
   - Well-structured error handling with proper logging
   - Clear and consistent coding style

2. Functionality
   - Market data retrieval fully implemented
   - WebSocket connection management verified
   - Price data processing validated
   - Reconnection logic tested and working
   - Callback system properly implemented

3. Error Handling
   - Comprehensive exception handling for WebSocket operations
   - Proper error isolation per trading pair
   - Exponential backoff for reconnection (1-60s)
   - JSON decode error handling
   - Callback error isolation

4. Documentation
   - Clear docstrings for all major components
   - Logging statements provide good operational visibility
   - Code comments explain complex logic
   - Type hints enhance code clarity

### Recommendations
1. Consider implementing message rate limiting for high-volume scenarios

2. Implement suggested rate limiting mechanism
3. Add performance metrics collection

### Security and Stability Verification
1. Connection Security
   - Using secure WebSocket (wss://)
   - Proper connection health monitoring with ping/pong
   - Safe error handling for connection failures

2. Data Processing
   - Input validation for market data
   - Safe JSON parsing with error handling
   - Proper type checking for received data

3. Resource Management
   - Proper cleanup on connection closure
   - Memory management through callback unregistration
   - Controlled reconnection attempts

4. Testing Coverage
   - Core functionality well tested
   - Error scenarios covered
   - Reconnection logic verified
   - Callback system validated

The implementation meets all minimal viable requirements with robust error handling and security measures. The code is production-ready with proper testing coverage.
