THREAD HANDOVER UPDATE - Emergency Manager to Order Execution Implementation

Current Status:
- Emergency manager fully implemented and tested
- All validation tests passing
- Position size limits working correctly
- State persistence confirmed working
- System health monitoring integrated

Last Changes Completed:
1. Implemented EmergencyManager:
   - Added validate_new_position method
   - Fixed position size validation logic
   - Implemented atomic state persistence
   - Added proper health check monitoring
   - Added detailed logging throughout

2. Test Coverage:
   - Basic position validation
   - Emergency mode blocking
   - Position size limits
   - Market data validation
   - Price movement detection
   - Volume spike detection
   - State persistence
   - System health monitoring
   - Edge case testing

Next Thread Priorities:
1. Order Execution Implementation:
   - Review current test failures in test_order_execution.py:
     * "No position exists" error in test_execute_limit_order
     * Mock verification failures in buy/sell order tests
     * Position tracking inconsistencies
   - Need to implement position initialization
   - Fix order validation logic
   - Address mock integration issues

2. Required Files to Modify:
   - crypto_j_trader/src/trading/order_execution.py
   - crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_order_execution.py
   - crypto_j_trader/tests/integration/test_trading_core.py

3. Integration Points:
   - EmergencyManager.validate_new_position
   - Risk management checks
   - Position tracking system
   - Market data validation

4. Known Issues to Address:
   - Position initialization missing
   - Mock verification failures
   - Order validation inconsistencies
   - Integration test failures

Key Knowledge Graph Updates:
- Added EmergencyManager component
- Added ValidateNewPosition method
- Added OrderValidation relationships
- Updated SystemHealth monitoring

Testing Requirements:
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Fix failing order execution tests
- Add position initialization tests
- Validate mock integrations

CI/CD Considerations:
- All emergency mode tests passing
- Position validation integrated
- Documentation updated
- Mock framework configured correctly

Security Notes:
- Position size limits enforced
- Order validation required
- System health monitoring active
- Emergency shutdown working

Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. Fix "No position exists" error in order execution
2. Implement position initialization
3. Fix mock verification failures
4. Update integration tests
5. Validate end-to-end order flow

Test Command Reference:
```bash
# Run order execution tests
python -m pytest crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_order_execution.py -v

# Run integration tests
python -m pytest crypto_j_trader/tests/integration/test_trading_core.py -v
```

Configuration Updates Required:
1. Update order_execution.py to handle missing positions
2. Configure mock framework in test_order_execution.py
3. Update trading core integration points
