## Completed Work

### Testing Infrastructure (Hours 6-8)
1. Directory Structure Implementation
```

└── examples/         # Example tests
```

2. Core Components
- Async testing support with pytest-asyncio
- Test fixtures and configuration management
- Coinbase API mock system
- Test runner script with multiple modes

3. Documentation
- Testing guide with best practices
- Example test implementations
- Infrastructure usage documentation

```

### Key Components Status
1. API Integration
- coinbase_api.py: 39% coverage
- exchange_service.py: 40% coverage
- websocket_handler.py: 9% coverage

2. Trading Core
- order_execution.py: 14% coverage
- position_manager.py: 14% coverage

### System Architecture
Current implementation follows the planned architecture:
```python
CoinbaseAdvancedClient  # API interaction
├── Authentication
├── Request handling
└── Error management

ExchangeService  # Service layer
├── Order management
├── Market data
└── Account services

OrderExecutor  # Trading system
├── Live trading
└── Paper trading
```

### Test Infrastructure
- ✓ Async testing framework
- ✓ Mock system implementation
- ✓ Test configuration
- ✓ Coverage reporting
- ✓ Example tests

## Technical Debt

### Coverage Gaps
1. Trading Core Components (Priority: High)
- trading_core.py (9% coverage)
- websocket_handler.py (9% coverage)
- position_tracking.py (0% coverage)

2. Risk Management (Priority: High)
- risk_management.py (13% coverage)
- position_manager.py (14% coverage)

3. Market Operations (Priority: Medium)
- market_data.py (16% coverage)
- health_monitor.py (18% coverage)

### Known Issues
1. Emergency Manager Coverage
- emergency_manager.py: Only 8% coverage
- Critical paths need testing

2. Performance Testing
- Benchmarks not yet established
- Load testing framework needed

## Next Steps

### Hours 8-10: Integration Testing
1. Service Integration Tests
- ExchangeService with API client
- OrderExecutor with ExchangeService
- System-wide workflows

2. API Interaction Tests
- Request/response validation
- Error handling scenarios
- Rate limiting tests

3. Performance Testing
- Response time benchmarks
- Resource usage monitoring
- Throughput testing

### Acceptance Criteria
- Integration test suite implemented
- API interaction test coverage >80%
- Performance benchmarks established
- All critical paths tested

## Notes for Next Thread
- Focus on integration testing implementation
- Prioritize critical component coverage
- Establish performance baselines
- Document all test scenarios
