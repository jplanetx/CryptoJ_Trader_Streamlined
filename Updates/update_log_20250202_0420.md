# CryptoJ Trader Development Update

**Date:** 2025-02-02 04:20 PST

## Status Overview

### Implementation Progress
- Completed implementation of core modules:
  - Risk Management
  - Emergency Manager
  - Health Monitor
  - WebSocket Handler
- Implemented comprehensive test suites for each module

### Critical Issues
All test suites are currently failing, likely due to:
1. Path resolution problems
2. Import structure issues
3. Test configuration setup
4. Potential mock implementation problems

### Technical Debt
- Test infrastructure needs proper setup
- Package structure needs review
- Import paths need correction
- Test configuration needs proper implementation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Setup proper test infrastructure
2. Fix import and path issues
3. Debug and fix test failures
4. Verify async test configuration

### Required Actions
1. Create proper conftest.py
2. Fix module import structure
3. Configure pytest correctly
4. Review and fix mock implementations

## Project Structure Review Needed
- Verify directory structure
- Check __init__.py files
- Review import statements
- Configure test discovery

The next development thread should focus on resolving these infrastructure issues before proceeding with additional feature implementation.

## Notes
- Core functionality is implemented but needs verification
- Test coverage cannot be determined until tests are running
- Infrastructure issues need resolution before continuing feature development
