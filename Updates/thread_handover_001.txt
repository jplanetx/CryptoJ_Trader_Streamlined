THREAD HANDOVER UPDATE - Risk Management to Emergency Mode Implementation

Current Status:
- Risk management module has been completely refactored
- All risk assessment and order validation tests passing
- Knowledge graph updated with new components and relationships

Last Changes Completed:
1. Enhanced risk_management.py:
   - Implemented standard deviation volatility calculation
   - Added position scaling factor
   - Fixed threshold comparison logic
   - Improved order validation and liquidity checks

2. Updated test_risk_management.py:
   - Added comprehensive test coverage
   - Included edge cases and boundary testing
   - Fixed assertion messages
   - Added new test cases for liquidity validation

Next Thread Priorities:
1. Emergency Mode Implementation:
   - Review emergency_manager.py current implementation
   - Implement missing validate_new_position method with the following requirements:
     * Check current positions against risk limits
     * Validate against market conditions
     * Integrate with existing risk management checks
   - Fix JSON persistence errors in test_emergency_shutdown_persistence
   - Address system health monitoring inconsistencies

2. Required Files to Modify:
   - crypto_j_trader/src/trading/emergency_manager.py
   - crypto_j_trader/tests/unit/test_emergency_shutdown.py

3. Integration Points:
   - RiskManager.assess_risk method (already updated)
   - MarketDataHandler for market condition validation
   - System health monitoring thresholds

4. Known Issues to Address:
   - JSON persistence errors in emergency shutdown tests
   - Missing validate_new_position implementation
   - Emergency mode state inconsistencies
   - System health monitoring threshold mismatches

Key Knowledge Graph Entities Added:
- RiskCalculation (Component)
- LiquidityValidation (Component)
- Relations established with RiskManager and MarketDataHandler

Testing Requirements:
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Add specific tests for validate_new_position
- Ensure emergency shutdown persistence tests pass
- Validate system health monitoring thresholds

CI/CD Considerations:
- All pytest configurations have been resolved
- New tests should follow existing patterns
- Maintain documentation standards

Security Notes:
- Emergency mode must maintain strict validation
- Position limits must be enforced during emergency scenarios
- System health checks must be accurate and reliable
