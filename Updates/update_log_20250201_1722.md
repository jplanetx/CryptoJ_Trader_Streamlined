Update Log
Status
Overall project development is progressing well with most unit tests passing.
The WebSocketHandler module currently has issues: the test_connect_success fails due to an error with using AsyncMock in an await expression and test_start_stop_lifecycle is throwing a MemoryError.
Integration tests for other modules (e.g., Coinbase API, order execution, paper trading) have shown stability, enabling continued development in core trading functionalities.
Completed Work
Implemented core trading functionalities including coinbase_api, exchange_service, paper_trading, order_execution, and trading_core.
Established a suite of unit tests covering initialization, connection, disconnection, and lifecycle operations of the WebSocketHandler.
Documented configuration handling and applied asynchronous logic in module implementations.
Set up testing infrastructure with pytest, asyncio support, and coverage reporting.
Technical Details
WebSocketHandler: Manages connection lifecycle, message handling, and subscription services for real-time data updates. Current issues with asynchronous mock handling indicate that improvements are needed in how AsyncMock is used to simulate WebSocket connections.
Testing Infrastructure: Uses pytest with asyncio integration. Warnings about "coroutine 'AsyncMockMixin._execute_mock_call' was never awaited" suggest potential misuse of asynchronous mocks.
Memory Management Issue: A MemoryError in test_start_stop_lifecycle indicates that the mock or the message loop in the WebSocketHandler may be consuming resources without proper cleanup.
Testing
Unit Tests: 4 out of 5 tests pass in test_websocket_handler.py.
Passed Tests: Initialization, connection failure, disconnection.
Failed Tests:
test_connect_success: Fails due to AsyncMock error when awaiting the connection.
test_start_stop_lifecycle: Fails with a MemoryError, likely due to resource leakage in the message loop.
Warnings: Resource warnings regarding unawaited coroutines, which need to be addressed to ensure cleaner shutdown of connections and mocks.
Next Steps
Resolve AsyncMock Usage: Review and refactor the asynchronous mock implementation in the tests for WebSocketHandler (especially in test_connect_success and test_start_stop_lifecycle).
Memory Leak Investigation: Analyze and fix the potential memory leak in the stop lifecycle method of WebSocketHandler.
Enhance Test Coverage: Extend unit tests to more thoroughly cover edge cases in connection retry logic and message handling.
Technical Debt Clearance: Address warnings and improve cleanup routines in the WebSocket message loop.
Documentation Update: Update inline code documentation in websocket_handler.py to clarify asynchronous behaviors and resource handling.
