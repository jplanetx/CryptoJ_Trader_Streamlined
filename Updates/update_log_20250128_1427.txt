# Implementation Review Report

## Module: 1
## Step: 1.1
## Date: 2025-01-28

### Review Summary
- Overall Status: Not Started
- Critical Issues: No
- Documentation Status: Not Started

### Detailed Findings

1. Code Quality
   - Root folder created at C:\Projects\CryptoJ_Trader_New
   - Branch 'minimal-viable-trader' exists
   - Component cleanup and identification not yet started

2. Functionality
   - Project structure initially created
   - Branch exists but needs component review and cleanup
   - Core files not yet identified
   - Project structure needs updating per minimal plan

3. Error Handling
   - Not yet applicable until core components are identified

4. Documentation
   - Initial project structure created
   - Need documentation of:
     * Core components to retain
     * Components to remove
     * Updated project structure

### Recommendations
1. Begin with component identification using minimal plan criteria
2. Document core vs non-essential components
3. Perform cleanup on minimal-viable-trader branch
4. Document all changes in a new update log

### Next Steps
1. Return to thread for Step 1.1 implementation
2. Follow implementation_plan_minimal.md guidelines
3. Create update log when changes are made
4. Request another review when Step 1.1 is complete

A new review will be needed once the implementation thread completes Step 1.1.
