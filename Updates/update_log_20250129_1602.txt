# Implementation Update Log
Date: 2025-01-29
Time: 16:02 (24-hour format)
Step: Module.3.1 Testing Resolution Thread
Status: In Progress

Changes Made:
- Created test implementation thread (docs/testing_implementation_thread.md)
- Identified core functionality gaps:
  * Basic order execution
  * Position tracking
  * Health monitoring
  * Error handling

Validation:
- Review of existing test files completed
- Core implementation requirements documented
- Implementation plan created with timeline

Next Steps:
1. Implement basic TradingBot functionality:
   - execute_order() method
   - get_position() method
   - check_health() method
2. Run unit tests to verify each component
3. Generate and review test coverage report
4. Address any test failures

Notes:
- Focus on minimal implementation to pass tests
- Defer complex features until core testing complete
- Follow implementation plan in testing_implementation_thread.md
